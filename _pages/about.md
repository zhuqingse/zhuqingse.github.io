Hi！I'm Tang Yilin from Beijing, China. I'm a recent master's graduate from Zhejiang University and will be starting my PhD in Spring 2026. My research interests lie in human-computer interaction, particularly human-centered AI. I'm especially passionate about AI ethics and AI for accessibility, as I firmly believe that ensuring AI serves humanity responsibly is of utmost importance. Beyond my studies, I have a strong passion for volunteering, during which I utilize large language models to provide personalized emotional training for children with autism and employ large-scale visual-language models to offer online social assistance for the blind and low-vision people. I also have a deep love for music, having learned and performed piano for 20 years. I’m open to forming a band or collaborating in ensemble performances!

%Site-wide configuration
%The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in _config.yml, which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site’s github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in _data/navigation.yml. For example, if you don’t have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

%Create content & metadata
%For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the _talks directory. At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the Talks page, each individual page for specific talks, the talks section for the CV page, and the map of places you’ve given a talk (if you run this python file or Jupyter notebook, which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).-->
